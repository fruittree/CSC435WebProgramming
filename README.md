# CSC435: Web Programming

This repository contains lecture slides, the homework solutions, and in-class demos used in CSC 435, Web Programming, taught at American University in DC, by Professor Bei Xiao. 

<h2>Course Overview:</h2>

This course is an introduction to programming for the World Wide Web. We will cover all the major pieces of how websites work. This will include the relationship between clients and servers, how web pages are constructed, and how the Internet works. We will NOT focus on how to stylize a website. Students who are interested in web design should take courses from the Graphic Design Program. 

We will examine several technologies in various depths, though our majority of time will spend on JavaScript and its libraries. 

<h2>Topics covered:</h2>

<ul>
<li>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) for authoring web pages
<li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for supplying stylistic information to web pages 
<li>JavaScript and its libraries (jQuery, D3) for creating interactive web pages 
<li> Servers, NodeJS and Express 	
<li> PHP Hypertext Processor for generating dynamic pages on a web server 
<li>Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax) for enhanced web interaction and applications 
<li>JSON for transferring data
<li>Structured Query Language (MySQL) for interacting with databases
</ul>
